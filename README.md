•System Calls and Monitoring Processes: Achieved the goal of hijacking (intercepting) system calls by writing and installing a very basic kernel module to the Linux kernel using C
•Virtual Memory: Implemented virtual-to-physical address translation and demand paging using a two-level page table and four different page replacement algorithms: FIFO, Clock, exact LRU, and OPT using C
